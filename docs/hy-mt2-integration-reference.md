# Hy-MT2 Translation Reference

## Source of truth

This reference follows Tencent's official [Hy-MT2-1.8B-GGUF model card](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hy-MT2-1.8B-GGUF) and the official [Hy-MT2 chat template](https://huggingface.co/tencent/Hy-MT2-1.8B/blob/main/chat_template.jinja).

## Target languages

The A and B reading-language selectors use these 38 entries from the official Supported Languages table. The complete English language name is the value used in the translation prompt.

## Request contract

The official request is one plain-text `user` message with no system message. Replace `{target_lang}` with the target language's complete English name and `{source_text}` with the finalized STT transcript. The blank line before `{source_text}` is required.

```text
Translate the following text into {target_lang}. Note that you should only output the translated result without any additional explanation:

{source_text}
```

The official GGUF chat template emits a begin-of-sentence token, a user token, the user message, and an assistant generation token. The template can process a system message, but the model card states that the 1.8B model has no default system prompt; this app does not send one.

Turn Translate uses Melange SDK `1.10.0`, whose inference entry point accepts a `String`, not chat messages. The app therefore renders the exact flat prompt below and passes that string to `SJ_zetic/Hy-MT2-1.8B`. Android and iOS must produce byte-equivalent output.

```text
<｜hy_begin▁of▁sentence｜><｜hy_User｜>Translate the following text into {target_lang}. Note that you should only output the translated result without any additional explanation:

{source_text}<｜hy_Assistant｜>
```

## App integration

At session start, the app downloads and loads `SJ_zetic/Hy-MT2-1.8B` through Melange SDK `1.10.0`. A loading state reports progress; a loading or inference failure reports an error with retry and never fabricates a translation. The app serializes translation requests. At session end and view-model teardown, it releases the model with the SDK cleanup and close lifecycle before returning to setup.

Configure `MELANGE_PERSONAL_KEY` with the root `./setup.sh` script; it must not appear in source control or logs. Android gives a build-environment value precedence over its local file. For iOS or CI, set the variable and run `./setup.sh` before building so Xcode reads the ignored local configuration. It is embedded into a development app binary for SDK initialization; this is unsuitable for production distribution, which requires rotatable credential provisioning. Model selection is fixed to `SJ_zetic/Hy-MT2-1.8B`; the app does not import models or select a GGUF quantization.
