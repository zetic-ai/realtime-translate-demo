# Turn Translate MVP Plan

## Goal

Build native Android and iOS apps for one device, where two people explicitly assign their utterances with A or B controls. Each platform uses on-device STT, and Melange SDK `1.10.0` loads `SJ_zetic/Hy-MT2-1.8B` when a session starts to translate finalized source text into the other person's reading language in a chat-style card.

## User flow

1. On the setup screen, users choose `Automatic` or an OS-derived on-device recognition language and a reading language for both A and B, then grant microphone and speech-recognition permissions.
2. Starting the session loads `SJ_zetic/Hy-MT2-1.8B` through Melange SDK `1.10.0`. The screen reports loading progress or a retryable error. PTT stays disabled until the model is ready.
3. On the conversation screen, A or B holds their own button. A tap starts recording and a second tap stops it as an accessibility alternative.
4. Only the active person's partial source text updates. The other button is disabled so exactly one on-device STT session is active.
5. Releasing the button or tapping to stop finalizes the STT source text.
6. A source text is translated serially into B's reading language; B source text is translated serially into A's reading language with Hy-MT2. The translation appears in the same card.
7. Ending the session waits for model cleanup and close, clears the prior conversation, and then returns to the setup screen, where users can select target languages for the next session.
8. When loading or translation fails, the source text remains visible and the translation area shows an error and retry action instead of a fabricated result.

## Pipeline

`Setup` -> `Load SJ_zetic/Hy-MT2-1.8B` -> `Ready` -> `User-selected A or B button` -> `Platform on-device STT using Automatic or an OS-derived recognition language` -> `Finalized source text` -> `Serial Hy-MT2 translation` -> `Chat card in the other person's reading language` -> `End, clean up, close, and clear` -> `Setup`

| Stage | Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Speaker assignment | A/B push-to-talk controls | The user explicitly identifies the speaker. |
| Android STT | `SpeechRecognizer.createOnDeviceSpeechRecognizer()` | Produces partial and final on-device source text for the selected speaker. |
| iOS STT | `SFSpeechRecognizer` with `requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true` | Produces partial and final on-device source text for the selected speaker. |
| Translation | Melange SDK `1.10.0` and `SJ_zetic/Hy-MT2-1.8B` | Loads the model once per session and serially translates finalized source text into the other person's reading language. |

STT and Hy-MT2 inference run off the UI thread. Hy-MT2 uses a serial queue that processes one finalized utterance at a time. Session startup loads the model asynchronously and reports progress. If model loading or runtime execution fails, the app shows an error rather than producing a translation. Session end waits for model cleanup and close, then clears the conversation before setup; view-model teardown also releases the model.

## Language scope

- Speaking languages for A and B: `Automatic` or an OS-derived on-device recognition language. Android API 33 and later lists installed on-device recognition locales. Android API 31-32 offers `Automatic` because installed-locale discovery is unavailable. iOS lists only supported locales that are on-device capable. The app does not restrict the source-language list, download speech models, or request online recognition.
- Reading languages for A and B: the 38 official Hy-MT2 options in the [Hy-MT2 translation reference](hy-mt2-integration-reference.md).
- A source text translates only into B's reading language, and B source text translates only into A's reading language. Automatic language detection and special handling for same-language pairs are out of scope.

The app does not preflight or gate a source language. If the platform cannot start the requested on-device recognition session, the app reports the platform error. It never falls back to network STT or automatically downloads a speech model.

## Scope and constraints

- One device does not support simultaneous A/B speech or concurrent STT sessions. The opposite button is disabled while an utterance is active.
- Automatic speaker separation, separate voice models, additional audio fan-out, and persistent storage of audio or conversations are out of scope.
- Accounts, sign-in, cloud sync, export or sharing, and telephone-call recording are out of scope.
- Configure `MELANGE_PERSONAL_KEY` through the root `./setup.sh` script. Android gives a build-environment value precedence over its local file; for iOS or CI, set the variable and run `./setup.sh` before building so Xcode reads the ignored local configuration. It is absent from source control and logs, but embedded into a development app binary for SDK initialization. That approach is not suitable for production distribution, which requires rotatable credential provisioning. Application and bundle identifiers and iOS signing configuration remain unchanged.

## Completion criteria

- Android and iOS implement the same A/B setup, model-loading gate, single-active PTT behavior, translation after source finalization, session-end unload, and error-recovery meaning.
- Each A/B utterance card shows the speaker label, source text, target language for the other person, translated text, and processing or error state in chronological order.
- Hold-to-talk and tap-toggle provide the same start/stop outcome and have accessibility labels.
- The reading-language selector matches the 38 official Hy-MT2 entries, and the request builder uses the documented one-user-message prompt.
- Starting a session loads `SJ_zetic/Hy-MT2-1.8B` with Melange SDK `1.10.0`; ending a session waits for cleanup and close, clears the prior conversation, and returns to target-language setup.
