/// input node goes quiet, and whatever it had transcribed so far is gone: there is no way to
/// resume an utterance that lost its microphone halfway through. So the app does not pretend
/// otherwise. The utterance dies the same way a failed `beginTurn` dies, the session and the
/// loaded model stay exactly where they were, and one gentle line says what happened.
///
/// Nothing here can be asserted by placing a real phone call, so the same split the rest of the
/// app uses applies again: the decision is a pure function over the session state, and the
/// `NotificationCenter` plumbing is the thin shell around it. The tests exercise the decision.
